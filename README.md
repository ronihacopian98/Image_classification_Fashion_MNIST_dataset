# Fashion MNIST Classification with Multiple Models

This project explores three different models for fashion item classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The models include a Feedforward Neural Network, a CNN with Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers, and a Transfer Learning model based on VGG16.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to compare and analyze the performance of three different models for fashion item classification. Each model is trained and evaluated individually, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## About FashionMnist Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images depicting 10 different categories of clothing and accessories. It is intended to be a replacement for the traditional MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits (0 through 9). Fashion MNIST is widely used in the machine learning community for testing and benchmarking various computer vision algorithms.

## Here are some key details about the Fashion MNIST dataset:

Categories (Classes): The dataset contains 10 classes, each representing a specific type of fashion item. The classes are as follows:

0: T-shirt/top

1: Trouser

2: Pullover

3: Dress

4: Coat

5: Sandal

6: Shirt

7: Sneaker

8: Bag

9: Ankle boot

Image Size: Each image in the dataset is 28x28 pixels, making it a grayscale image.

Number of Samples: There are 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples.

Format: The dataset is often provided in a format where each image is associated with a corresponding label indicating the class it belongs to. For example, a pair (image, label) might represent an image of a T-shirt (class 0).

Usage: Fashion MNIST is commonly used for educational purposes, especially in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It's often used as a beginner-friendly dataset for practicing image classification tasks.

The dataset is easily accessible and can be loaded using popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. It has become a standard benchmark for testing the performance of various image classification models.
